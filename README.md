A simple, secure, and beautiful tool to visualize exported WhatsApp chats.

## Purpose

WhatsApp currently does not allow new group participants to view messages sent before they joined. This tool solves that problem. You can ask an existing group member or the creator to export the chat history and send it to you. Then, use this tool to visualize and read the entire conversation history comfortably.
